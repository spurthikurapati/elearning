# 🎓 Online Education Platform – Playlist, Notes, and Certificates

## 📘 Overview

The **Online Education Platform** is a dynamic, responsive, and modern web-based learning interface built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It enables students to explore various programming and computer science courses through integrated **YouTube playlists** and **notes**, while tracking video progress persistently using **localStorage**. Additionally, it includes a **certificate generation system** and a clean **sign-in interface**.

Designed with a mobile-first approach and a smooth user experience in mind, this platform is ideal for students and self-learners who want to access educational content with progress tracking and personalized certification – all in one place.
